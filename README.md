# U-net-for-geo
U-net is a universal deep learning model for geology problems, which can be used in reduction dimension and construct surrogate models. In this part, we provide a simple U-net model for Gaussian field reconstruction. Hope our work can help u and here are some papers using U-net to solve geology problems. By the way, if u are interested in applying deep learning models for geology problems, u can contact me (k13791782768@gmail.com)
